# Automated-Detection-of-Defects-on-Metal-Surfaces-using-Machine-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques
This project utilizes machine and deep learning techniques to automate the detection of defects on metal surfaces in industrial products.
The goal of this project is to classify various common metal defects such as: crescent gap

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of all the steps taken to improve the accuracy of the system. 
## The repository includees:
- Classification between two defects only using Sigmoid activation 
- Classification between all defects using sigmoid activation
- Using of pretrained models to detect a single defect only:
  - VGG19 
  - Inception 
- Training the annotations using Inception on single defect
- Training the annotations on detecting more than one defect in the image using inception
- Using VIT as a feature extractor instead of the pretained model
