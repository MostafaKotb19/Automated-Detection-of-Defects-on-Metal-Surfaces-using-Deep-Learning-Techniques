# Automated-Detection-of-Defects-on-Metal-Surfaces-using-Machine-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques
This project utilizes machine and deep learning techniques to automate the detection of defects on metal surfaces in industrial products.
The goal of this project is to classify various common metal defects. This repository serves as a comprehensive record of all the steps taken to improve the accuracy of the system. 
## The repository includees:
- Classification between two defects only Sigmoid activation 
- Detection of a single defect only with more than one model architecture:
